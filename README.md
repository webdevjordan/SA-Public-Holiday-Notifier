# SA Public Holiday Notifier

## Reason for Creating This

> The last time I kept track of public holidays was during my school and college years ‚Äî you know, when it really mattered.
>
> Unfortunately, once I began working, I started forgetting these important days, to the point where I needed to be reminded by friends and family.
>
> So, as an early sign of ‚Äúcalendar amnesia,‚Äù I decided to create a simple Discord bot that sends a message to my Discord server whenever today is a public holiday.
